# Food Recycler API

## Short description
Food Recycler implements a RESTful API that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. REST technology uses little bandwidth, making it suitable for internet usage â€“ therefore, using a RESTful API makes data manipulation a lot easier.

## Database design
We've chosen MySQL for our app for a couple of reasons:
1. the fact that it's designed and optimized for Web applications
2. its exceptional performance and scalability

We then began the database design process, which resulted in a simple, but effective database schema:
