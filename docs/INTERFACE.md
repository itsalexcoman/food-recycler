# User Interface

## Short description
We've tried to make Food Recycler as intuitive as possible by limiting both the number and the complexity of the screens users can interact with:
- **Homepage** – displays the app logo and description, as well as authentication buttons
- **Login & Register** – classic login & register screens, nothing too fancy
- **Fridge UI** – the main functional component of the application, which allows users to:
    - keep track of food & expiry dates, as well as add or remove items
    - claim items from other users
- **Community** – the main social interaction screen that enables users to:
    - create, view or join groups
    - add or remove members from them
    - view available products (be it in a group or the whole bunch of them)
