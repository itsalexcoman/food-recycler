# Food Recycler
Food Recycler is an SPA that can be used to prevent food waste by sharing food they no longer plan on consuming.

### Goals
 - Raising awareness about food waste in a fun, community-based manner
 - Providing the Fridge UI for users, so as to be able to organize food by categories and always be aware of the amount of food in a user's fridge
 - Notifications for upcoming expiry dates
 - Providing a way to decide which food items will be kept and which will be shared
 - Group functionality, so that food will be shared with specific users
 - Integration with popular social media platforms
